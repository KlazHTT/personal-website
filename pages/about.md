# About

My name is Hao Tran. ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in the intersections between productivity, knowledge, and technology. Most of my personal time is dedicated to consuming informational content, tinkering with software, and playing video games.

Sometimes I enjoy writing and sharing my thoughts and experiences.
