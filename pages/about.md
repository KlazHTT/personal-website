My name is Hao Tran. ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in the intersections of productivity, knowledge, and technology. Most of my personal time is dedicated to consuming informational content, tinkering with software, and playing video games.

- See my [reading history](https://trello.com/b/luhlPjL7/reading) on Trello.

Sometimes I enjoy writing and sharing my thoughts and experiences.
