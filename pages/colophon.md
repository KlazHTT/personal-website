This URL has been my online home for many years and acts as a central hub for my online identity, communication, and work. It was once a personal blog, but I found more enjoyment with keeping an analog journal and using a fountain pen to articulate and express my thoughts.

Currently, I use this space as a playground to keep up-to-date and experiment with web design practices. I like obsessing over pixel-sized details while improving interactions and accesibility.
