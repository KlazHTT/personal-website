# Using

Here is a list of notable equipment and tools I use. The purpose of this list is to remind myself to be intentional about the things that I surround myself with and utilize on a daily basis.

- **Chair**: Herman Miller Aeron (*Purchased in 2023*)

- **Mice**:

  - Speakers: Kanto YU2 (*Purchased in 2023*)

## Software

### General
- **Operating system**: [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) KDE
  - In 2024, I switched over from Windows 11 to using Linux on my personal computer. Surprisingly, the transition has been smooth sailing with some minor audio/video issues that were easy to fix.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Arch Linux, Solus, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Windows 11/10/8/XP/1998, Mac OS X Snow Leopard, etc.
- **Browser**: [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
  - Hardened for my daily usage.
  - Sometimes I use [Brave](https://brave.com/) if I need to use a Chromium-based browser.
- **Password Manager**: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- **RSS feed reader**: [CommaFeed](https://www.commafeed.com/)

### Communications
- **Email**: [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail)
  - Alternatives I've tried: Fastmail, Gmail, Hotmail
- **Chat**: [Discord](https://discord.com/)
  - I don't like how reliant gamers have become on Discord for communications.
  - However, I also don't miss the days of having to install Ventrilo, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Skype, RaidCall, Curse Voice, etc. on your computer because different teams and friend groups used different voice programs.

### Productivity
- **Calendar**: [ProtonCalendar](https://proton.me/calendar)
- **Notes**: [Capacities](https://capacities.io/)
  - I've tried and used an unbelievable number of note-taking applications over the years.
  - Capacities has been the only app that has made sense to me in terms of linking relevant notes together. It also checks the boxes for features that I am looking for in a note-taking application.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Obsidian, Logseq, Standard Notes, BookStack, Joblin, Notion, Simple Note, TiddlyWiki, GitBook, Notational Velocity, Evernote, OneNote, etc.
- **Kanban**: Trello
  - Currently considering: [WeKan](https://wekan.github.io/), [Planka](https://planka.app/)
- **Budgeting**: [Actual](https://actualbudget.org/)
  - I like budgeting using the envelope system.
  - Alternatives I've tried: You Need A Budget

### Development
- **Font**: Hack Nerd Font
- **Theme**: [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme) Dark
- **Tabs**: 2 spaces
- **Terminal emulator**: Konsole
  - It comes with the KDE desktop environment.
  - I don't use the terminal enough to develop a personal preference.
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code
  - It works and does what I need it to do out-of-the-box.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Neovim, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, Notepad++, Notepad, etc.
- **Repository**: [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)
  - Currently, I am using a self-hosted Gitea to store my project repositories.
  - Also using GitHub to mirror my project repositories.

## Paid Subscriptions and Services

Here are online subscriptions and services that I pay for:

| Subscriptions | Annual USD | Monthly USD | Monthly CAD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Bitwarden | $10.00 | $0.83 | $1.19 |
| Hover (domain names) | $55.33 | $4.61 | $6.63 |
| Bear (blogging platform) | $49.00 | $4.08 | $5.89 |
| PikaPods (hosting web apps) | $57.72 | $4.81 | $6.95 |
| Proton (Mail Plus) | $47.99 | $3.99 | $5.74 |
| Discord (Nitro Basic) | $33.89 | $2.82 | $4.05 |
| Spotify (Duo) | $149.40 | $12.45 | $17.89 |
| Video streaming (various) | $166.92 | $13.91 | $20.00 |
| Gaming services | $166.92 | $13.91 | $20.00 |
| **Totals** | **$737.17** | **$61.41** | **$88.34** |

For PikaPods, I have a couple web apps deployed using their managed services:
- [Actual](https://actualbudget.org/) for personal budgeting using the envelop method.
- [CommaFeed](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/) for reading RSS feeds.
- [Gitea](https://gitea.com/) for my personal project repositories.

For video streaming, I rotate through a number of services and only subscribe for a month at a time to watch what I want. In some months, I don't have an active subscription running, so this number is a little inflated.

Overall, I am quite happy with how much I am spending on my online subscriptions. It could be better, but I am satisfied that it is below $100 CAD per month.
