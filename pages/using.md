# Using

Here is a list of notable equipment and tools I use. The purpose of this list is to remind myself to be intentional about the things that I surround myself with and utilize on a daily basis.

Last updated: {{ post_last_modified }} ago

## At the Desk

### Workspace
- **Desk**: Custom-built sit-stand desk (*Built in 2022*)

- **Chair**: Herman Miller Aeron (*Purchased in 2023*)

  - If the Aeron did not exist, I would have purchased the Embody.

## Carry
- Backpack: Bellroy Transit Workpack, 20L (*Purchased in 2022*)
  - I have the V1. 
  - I think the V2 is a downgrade due to the removal of the quick access side pockets.
- Sling: Heimplanet Transit Line Sling, 2L (*Purchased in 2022*)
  - Convenient bag to carry my essentials during the warmer months when I don't wear a jacket with pockets.

- **Mice**:

  - Speakers: Kanto YU2 (*Purchased in 2023*)

## Software

### General
- **Operating system**: [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) KDE
  - In 2024, I switched over from Windows 11 to using Linux on my personal computer. Surprisingly, the transition has been smooth sailing with some minor audio/video issues that were easy to fix.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Arch Linux, Solus, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Windows 11/10/8/XP/1998, Mac OS X Snow Leopard, etc.
- **Browser**: [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
  - Hardened for my daily usage.
  - Sometimes I use [Brave](https://brave.com/) if I need to use a Chromium-based browser.
- **Password Manager**: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- **RSS feed reader**: [CommaFeed](https://www.commafeed.com/)

### Communications
- **Email**: [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail)
  - Alternatives I've tried: Fastmail, Gmail, Hotmail
- **Chat**: [Discord](https://discord.com/)
  - I don't like how reliant gamers have become on Discord for communications.
  - However, I also don't miss the days of having to install Ventrilo, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Skype, RaidCall, Curse Voice, etc. on your computer because different teams and friend groups used different voice programs.

### Productivity
- **Calendar**: [ProtonCalendar](https://proton.me/calendar)
- **Notes**: [Capacities](https://capacities.io/)
  - I've tried and used an unbelievable number of note-taking applications over the years.
  - Capacities has been the only app that has made sense to me in terms of linking relevant notes together. It also checks the boxes for features that I am looking for in a note-taking application.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Obsidian, Logseq, Standard Notes, BookStack, Joblin, Notion, Simple Note, TiddlyWiki, GitBook, Notational Velocity, Evernote, OneNote, etc.
- **Kanban**: Trello
  - Currently considering: [WeKan](https://wekan.github.io/), [Planka](https://planka.app/)
- **Budgeting**: [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/)
  - I like budgeting using the envelope system.
  - Alternatives I've tried: [Actual](https://actualbudget.org/), [Lunch Money](https://lunchmoney.app/)

### Development
- **Font**: Hack Nerd Font
- **Theme**: [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme) Dark
- **Tabs**: 2 spaces
- **Terminal emulator**: Konsole
  - It comes with the KDE desktop environment.
  - I don't use the terminal enough to develop a personal preference.
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code
  - It works and does what I need it to do out-of-the-box.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Neovim, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, Notepad++, Notepad, etc.
- **Repository**: [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)
  - Currently, I am using a self-hosted Gitea to store my project repositories.
  - Also using GitHub to mirror my project repositories.

## Paid Subscriptions and Services

Here are online subscriptions and services that I pay for:

| Subscriptions               |  Annual USD | Monthly USD | Monthly CAD |
| --------------------------- | ----------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| Bitwarden                   |      $10.00 |       $0.83 |       $1.19 |
| Hover (domain names)        |      $55.33 |       $4.61 |       $6.63 |
| Bear (blogging platform)    |      $49.00 |       $4.08 |       $5.89 |
| PikaPods (hosting web apps) |      $60.36 |       $5.03 |       $7.19 |
| Proton (Mail Plus)          |      $47.99 |       $3.99 |       $5.74 |
| Discord (Nitro Basic)       |      $33.89 |       $2.82 |       $4.05 |
| YNAB (budgeting)            |     $109.00 |       $9.08 |      $12.98 |
| Spotify (Duo)               |     $149.40 |      $12.45 |      $17.89 |
| Video streaming (various)   |     $166.92 |      $13.91 |      $20.00 |
| Gaming subscriptions        |     $166.92 |      $13.91 |      $20.00 |
| **Totals**                  | **$848.81** |  **$70.71** |  **$101.56** |

For PikaPods, I have a couple web apps deployed using their managed services:
- [CommaFeed](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/) for reading RSS feeds.
- [Gitea](https://gitea.com/) for my personal project repositories.
- [Umami](https://umami.is/) for website analytics.

For video streaming, I rotate through a number of services and only subscribe for a month at a time to watch what I want. In some months, I don't have an active subscription running, so this number is a little inflated.

For gaming subscriptions, similar to above idea.

Overall, I am quite happy with how much I am spending on my online subscriptions. It could be better, but I am satisfied that it is about $100 CAD per month.
