Here is a list of notable equipment and tools I use. The purpose of this list is to remind myself to be intentional about the things that I surround myself with and utilize on a daily basis.

## Software

### General
- **Operating system**: [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) KDE
  - In 2024, I switched over to using Linux on my personal computer. Surprisingly, the transition has been smooth sailing with some minor audio/video issues that were easy to fix. 
  - Alternatives I've tried: Arch Linux, Solus, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Windows 11/10/8/XP/1998, Mac OS X Snow Leopard, etc.
- **Browser**: [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
  - Hardened for my daily usage.
  - Sometimes I use [Brave](https://brave.com/) if I need to use a Chromium-based browser.
- **Password Manager**: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- **RSS feed reader**: [CommaFeed](https://www.commafeed.com/)

### Communications
- **Email**: [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail)
  - Using a custom domain for your email makes it easier to switch email providers.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Fastmail, Gmail, Hotmail
- **Chat**: [Discord](https://discord.com/)
  - I don't like how reliant gamers have become on Discord functioning.
  - However, I also don't miss the days of having to install Ventrilo, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Skype, RaidCall, Curse Voice, etc. on your computer because different teams and friend groups used different voice programs.

### Productivity
- **Calendar**: [ProtonCalendar](https://proton.me/calendar)
- **Notes**: [Capacities](https://capacities.io/)
  - I've tried and used an unbelieveable number of note-taking applications over the years.
  - Capacities has been the only app that has made sense to me in terms of linking relavant notes together. It also checks the boxes for features that I am looking for in a note-taking application.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Obsidian, Logseq, Standard Notes, BookStack, Joblin, Notion, Simple Note, TiddlyWiki, GitBook, Notational Velocity, Evernote, OneNote, etc.
- **Kanban**: Trello
  - Currently considering: [WeKan](https://wekan.github.io/), [Planka](https://planka.app/)
  - I want to move towards using an open source platform.
- **Budgeting**: You Need A Budget
  - I like budgeting using the envelope system.

### Development
- **Font**: Hack Nerd Font
- **Theme**: [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme) Dark
- **Tabs**: 2 spaces
- **Terminal emulator**: Konsole
  - It comes with the KDE desktop environment.
  - I don't use the terminal enough to develop a personal preference.
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code
  - It works and does what I need it to do out-of-the-box.
  - Alternatives I've tried: Neovim, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, Notepad++, Notepad, etc.
- **Repository**: [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)
  - Currently, I am using a self-hosted Gitea to store my project repositories.
  - Also using GitHub to mirror my project repositories.

## Paid Subscriptions and Services

Here are online subscriptions and services that I pay for:

| Services                                | Annual USD | Monthly USD | Monthly CAD (approx.) |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------: | ----------: | --------------------: |
| Bitwarden                               |     $10.00 |       $0.83 |
| Hover (for 3x domain names)             |     $54.97 |       $4.58 |
| Proton (Mail Plus)                      |     $47.88 |       $3.99 |
| Discord (Nitro Basic)                   |     $35.88 |       $2.99 |
| PikaPods (for hosting web apps)         |     $84.00 |       $7.00 |
| Ghost(Pro) (for managing this website!) |    $108.00 |       $9.00 |
| You Need A Budget                       |    $109.00 |       $9.08 |
| Video streaming (various)               |    $180.00 |      $15.00 |
| Totals                                  |            |             |

For PikaPods, I have a couple web apps deployed using their managed services:
- [Gitea](https://gitea.com/) for my personal project repositories.
- [CommaFeed](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/) for reading RSS feeds.
- [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) as my personal music streaming service.
- [Umami](https://umami.is/) for collecting and analyzing visitor metrics.

For video streaming, I rotate through a number of services and only subscribe for a month at a time to watch what I want. In some months, I don't have an active subcription running, so this number is a little inflated.

For 2025:
- I intend to stop using YNAB because its subscription cost has significantly increased over the years and no longer feels worth it to me. Currently, considering using [Actual](https://actualbudget.com/) which would slightly increase my PikaPod costs for an additional managed web app.
- Consider whether Ghost(Pro) is worth it.
