I've tried keeping various blogs over the years but never managed to keep them going despite having so much that I want to write about and let out into the world.

My primary issue was that I would select processes and platforms that caused a lot of friction between writing and posting, so I never wanted to go through the effort of posting a quick thought snippet. This time, I'm committed to using a dedicated blog platform to make the writing process easier for myself.

At an initial glance, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) seems to be what I am looking for with its built-in features and clean interface. It offers a generous amount of official themes I can work with, so I am not too tempted to design and develop a personalized theme. I like that it is super focused on blog and newsletter writing, which is something that I think I am aiming towards.

Let's see if this one sticks. Hopefully, it does!
