I've tried keeping various blogs over the years but never managed to keep them going despite having so much that I want to write about and let out into the world.

I think the primary issue was that I would select processes and platforms that caused a lot of friction between writing and posting, so I never wanted to go through the effort of posting a quick thought snippet.

This time I have decided to use a dedicated blog platform to make it easier on myself. At an initial glance, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) seems snappy and has enough features to satisfy my needs for now.

Let's see if this one sticks. Hopefully, it does.
