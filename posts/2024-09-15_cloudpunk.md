> *A neon-noir story in a rain-drenched cyberpunk metropolis. It’s your first night on the job working for the Cloudpunk delivery service. Two rules: Don’t miss a delivery and don’t ask what’s in the package.*

*Cloudpunk* delivers the experience of what it is like to be a delivery driver cruising from point A to point B in a neon-lit cyberpunk city filled with skyscrapers while driving a flying vehicle and listening to relaxing music.

Frequently, there are scripted conversations between characters that flesh out the realities of living in the city and the daily lives of its inhabitants, which were engaging enough for me to look forward to hearing the ringing tone of the communication system and being able to learn more. Discussions about class systems, ethics about using AI, what is considered a life form, and corporate dystopian control were woven into the narrative as you deliver packages and taxi people to their destinations.

I guess you can call this an interactive visual novel experience because your choices don't fundamentally affect the story. There are a few missions that have a timer, but even if you miss a check, there isn't a lasting consequence as NPCs would excuse away the missed timer on your behalf. However, I did spot one achievement to successfully complete all time-sensitive deliveries — which is something to note for completionists.

Both the voice acting and the music were fantastic. Line deliveries were great, especially by one of the characters called Huxley. And the ambient, synth-heavy (synthwave?) soundtrack complemented the cyberpunk atmosphere perfectly as you weaved through traffic and towers alike.

I think the weakest part of *Cloudpunk* is most of the out-of-vehicle sections that force players to navigate around convoluted platforms and wait for a ridiculous number of elevators. Many times I have walked into a dead-end and had to backtrack to go to a different Z-axis to get to my destination point (and then meander my way back to my vehicle too!) which is quite frustrating due to the slow walking speed and limited map capabilities.

I think if the developers increased the walking speed, then most of my frustrations with this game would be alleviated and make the out-of-vehicle sections feel less like a chore.

Overall, the game has a great vibe that I wouldn't mind driving through again. I was pleasantly surprised by the super chill experience.
