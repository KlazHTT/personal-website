When I was a child, my parents took me on a guided bus tour to see Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City. I know that we visited numerous museums, art galleries, landmarks, and other notable sites, but I don't remember much about those few days except for missing home. 

However, I still vividly remember the end of our trip.

Back in Toronto, as my parents and I disembarked from the bus, the driver called out to us to wait for a moment. We had barely interacted with the driver throughout our entire trip, so it was curious of him to single us out like that. He approached us and removed his faded blue baseball cap before kneeling in front of me. And in the midst of downtown pedestrian sidewalk traffic, we studied each other for a long moment.

He then said something which has continued to perplex me to this day.

He said, "You're going to do something great some day."

I think about that a lot.
